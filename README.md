- Java (required by Allure CLI)
- Playwright installed in your project

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test allure-playwright
```

### 2. Configure Reporter

Update your `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['line'],
    ['allure-playwright']
  ],
});
```

You can also pass custom options like `environmentInfo` for OS and Node version details:

```typescript
import * as os from 'node:os';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['line'],
    ['allure-playwright', {
      environmentInfo: {
        os_platform: os.platform(),
        os_release: os.release(),
        node_version: process.version,
      },
    }],
  ],
});
```

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Test results will be saved to the `allure-results` directory.

### 4. Generate Allure Report

```bash
allure serve allure-results
```

This will launch a browser window with the generated report.

## 🧪 Writing Enhanced Tests

Use Allure's Runtime API to enrich your test reports:

```typescript
import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import * as allure from 'allure-js-commons';

test('Login Test', async () => {
  await allure.owner('QA Engineer');
  await allure.severity('critical');
  await allure.tag('authentication', 'smoke');
  await allure.step('Open login page', async () => {
    // test logic
  });
});
```

---

## 📎 Attachments

Add screenshots or logs:

```typescript
await allure.attachment('Screenshot', '/path/to/image.png', {
  contentType: 'image/png',
  fileExtension: 'png',
});
```

---

## 📂 Test Plan Filtering

Run only selected tests using a test plan file:

```bash
export ALLURE_TESTPLAN_PATH=testplan.json
npx playwright test
```

---

## 🧭 Environment Info

Include system details in your config as shown above.
